# sllab.io

The website for SLLAB itself: what the project is, and how a team can get in touch for early access. It's part of [SLLAB](../../README.md), and is separate from the [club sites](../club-sites), which belong to each club.

Built with Next.js 16, React 19 and Tailwind CSS 4. It has no backend and no environment variables; every page is static.

## Pages

- **Home** (`/`): the headline and a link to get in touch.
- **Contact** (`/contact`): email, location, and how early access works.
- **Fixture's policies** (`/fixture/privacy`, `/fixture/terms`, `/fixture/support`): the privacy policy, terms and support page for [Fixture by SLLAB](../fixture-ios), linked from the App Store listing and from club sites.

The site has light and dark themes with a toggle, scroll-triggered reveal animations, and transitions between pages.
